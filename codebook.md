The data used for the project of the Get Data course is the Human Activity
Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita,
Alessandro Ghio and Luca Oneto.

They carried out the experiments with a group of 30 subjects within an age
bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING,
WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded
accelerometer and gyroscope, they captured 3-axial linear acceleration and
3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

The original data provides:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the
estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

For this project the original dataset was merged, cleaned and labeled, and
the averages for the mean and standard deviation of the following measurements
were calculated by activity and subject:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
